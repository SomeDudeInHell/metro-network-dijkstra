# metro-network-dijkstra
Developed a C-based transit network simulator for metro, local stations, and bus stops using dynamic data structures. Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for shortest path finding with robust file I/O and error handling. Demonstrates strong C programming, algorithm design, and memory management skills.
Transit Network Shortest Path Finder ðŸš†ðŸšŒ
A C-based transit network simulator that models metro stations, local train stations, and bus stops. Implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between transit points, using a dynamically allocated adjacency list.

Features âœ¨
âœ… Multi-Transit Support â€“ Simulates metro, train stations, and bus stops.
âœ… Shortest Path Calculation â€“ Uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the optimal route.
âœ… File-Based Network Input â€“ Reads transit data from a file for easy setup.
âœ… Efficient Memory Management â€“ Uses dynamic allocation and proper deallocation.
âœ… User Interaction â€“ Interactive CLI for inputting stations and displaying routes.
